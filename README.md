# ðŸ§© Python Quality Pipeline

This repository aims to **standardize Python scripts**, **automate code validation**, and **enable continuous integration (CI/CD)** for data and software projects.  
It ensures consistency, readability, and quality across all codebases.


## ðŸš€ Overview

The **Python Quality Pipeline** automates:
- Linting and code style enforcement  
- Import sorting and formatting  
- Static type validation  
- Unit testing and coverage reports  
- Continuous integration through GitHub Actions

## ðŸ§± Stack

| Purpose | Tool | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Code Style | **Black** | Enforces consistent code formatting |
| Imports | **Isort** | Automatically sorts and organizes imports |
| Linting | **Flake8** | Detects syntax errors and style issues |
| Testing | **Pytest** | Runs automated tests |
| Data Validation | **Pydantic** | Provides type-safe validation for configurations and data models |
| CI/CD | **GitHub Actions** | Runs the entire pipeline automatically on each commit or pull request |

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Automatic code style checks before merging  
- Static analysis and linting via pre-commit hooks  
- Unit tests triggered in CI/CD pipelines  
- Enforced conventions (PEP8, typing, formatting)  
- Clear structure for scalable Data Engineering and Python projects
